By default, sed outputs the edited text to standard output.
However, we can use the -i option to edit files in place.
For example, suppose we want to replace all occurrences of "IT403" with "IT4O3" in a file, and we want to edit the file in place.

This is some text with the word "IT403" / "IT403" / "IT403" .
