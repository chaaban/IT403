# Guess The Container

```
A classic guessing game where the player has to guess the position 
a hidden object among a set of shuffled containers.
```

## Usage/Examples

```
1. Set Up the Game:
   - Define the number of containers to use in the game (e.g. 3 or 5).
   - The object is hidden randomly in a container.

2. Display the Containers:
   - Print the containers to the terminal, indicating their positions using numbers(e.g.[1],[2],[3).

3. Prompt for User Input:
   - Ask the player to enter their guess for the position of the hidden object.

4. Validate the Input:
   - Ensure that the user enters a valid number corresponding to one of the containers.
   - Validate the input to prevent errors or cheating.

5. Check the Guess:
   - Compare the player's guess with the position of the hidden object.
   - If the guess is correct, display a success message.
   - If the guess is incorrect, display a failure message.

6. Repeat or End the Game:
   - Ask the player if they want to play again.
   - If the player chooses to continue, repeat the steps from displaying the containers.
   - If the player chooses to end the game, display a goodbye message and exit the script.

```
## Code Functionality
```
The user is first prompted to enter the number of containers.The containers
are then displayed but shuffled, and the user is asked to enter his guess,
also he's informed if he guessed it correctly or not and if not the game 
displays where the object was hidden.Then a prompt appears asking if the 
user wants to play again, until the player enters "n",if so he exits the game.
```
