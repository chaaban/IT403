# Phone Number Converter:
A program in bash script code that’ll accept a phone number with letters and convert it to a phone number with only digits. For example, if you sent the program a phone number like 800888TEST, it should return (800) 888-8378. Note that it shouldn’t only convert letters to the digits they represent but also format the number correctly with parentheses and dashes. And, if you send the program an invalid number, it should throw an error.
# Functions:

1-The **convert_letter_to_digit** function is defined. It takes a letter as input and uses a case statement to convert the letter to its corresponding digit. 
If the letter is not a valid digit, it is returned as is.

2-The **format_phone_number** takes a number as input and formats it by adding parentheses and a dash in the appropriate positions.

3-The number of command-line arguments is validated using **if [[ $# -ne 1 ]]; then**. If the number of arguments is not equal to 1, an error message is displayed, and
 the script exits with a non-zero status using exit 1.

4-The input phone number is extracted from the command-line argument and stored in the variable **phone_number**.

5-The input phone number is validated as a valid phone number using **if ! [[ $phone_number =~ ^[0-9A-Za-z]{10}$ ]]; then**. If the phone number does not match the
 pattern of 10 alphanumeric characters, an error message is displayed, and the script exits with a non-zero status.

6-A loop is used to iterate over each character in the phone number. **The convert_letter_to_digit** function is called for each character to convert any letter to its 
corresponding digit. The converted digits are appended to the 'converted_number variable'.

7-After the loop, the **format_phone_number** function is called with the **converted_number** as input. It formats the converted number by adding parentheses and a dash,
 and the formatted number is stored in the **formatted_number** variable.

8-Finally, the original phone number and the converted phone number are displayed as output using **echo**.

## Features:

- Letter-to-digit conversion
- Phone number formatting
- Input validation
- Iterative conversion using loop
- Output display

## Prerequisites:
 
 - Bash environment
 - Valid phone number format

## Usage:

 - Save the code to a file, e.g., phone_number_converter.sh.
 - Open a terminal or command prompt.
 - Navigate to the directory where the script file is saved.
 - Make the script file executable by running the command: chmod +x phone_number_converter.sh.
 - Run the script by executing the command: ./phone_number_converter.sh <phone_number>, where <phone_number> is the phone number you want to convert.

## Helpful:
- Data Processing: If you have a dataset containing phone numbers with letters and you need to convert them to a standardized format for further processing or analysis, this code can automate the conversion process.
- Data Cleaning: If you have a database or a file containing phone numbers with letters, you can use this code to clean up the data by converting the numbers to a consistent format.
