Network Usage Monitor

This bash script monitors the network usage for all available interfaces and accumulates the total usage. It refreshes the statistics every 5 seconds and prints the time and the amount of data used by each interface. When the user presses Ctrl+C to terminate the script, it displays the total usage and elapsed time in minutes and seconds.
